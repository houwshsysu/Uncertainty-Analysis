#Code description:
The code computes the iso-surfaces of geological attribute probabilities and their vector parameters. The code shold be implemented by Visual studio 2011/2012. It uses Monte Carlo method to simulate the error distribution on each nodes of initial surface. Results of vector parameters are output as features of ArcGIS and are speedily and accurately produced. 

The code can thus be used in areas where uncertainty analysis for sub-sureface, for example geological structural surface.
